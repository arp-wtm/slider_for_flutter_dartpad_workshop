**STEP 1**
**- The pub.dev site lists many open source packagesâ€”developed by Google engineers and generous members<br>
**- of the Flutter and Dart community. Use material.dart';**<br>
**- execution of a Dart program starts from the main()function.<br>
**- when main calls a function, it passes the execution control to that function.
**- create the main and runApp function passing MyApp widget as parameter<br>
**- MyApp will be the root widget of the application (the application itself)<br>
**- create a new stateful widget MyApp to return an empty red container**<br>
**- click the 'Run' button.**
